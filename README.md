# The Lynx Programming Language

It's still in the early stage of development.
Stay tuned.

## Philosophy

> _Unify, simplify, generalize - and make it intuitive._

Lynx is designed to be dynamic, flexible and concise, with a focus on reasonable abstractions such as:

-   a delicate type system, where types are first-class values;

-   lambda expressions with multi-branch pattern matching as a primitive;

-   customizable infix operators and metaprogramming capability.

It encourges a functional style, and yet emphasizes expressive freedom over enforced paradigm.

## Documentation

Here is a [language overview](docs/lynx-overview.md).

For a glimpse at Lynx code, please refer to the [examples](examples) folder.

Note that the current syntax is not yet complete,
and significant modifications are expected in the future.
