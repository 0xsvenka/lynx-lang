# The Lynx Programming Language

It's still in the early stage of development. Stay tuned.

## Philosophy

_Simplicity, generality, flexibility - and being intuitive._

Lynx focuses on reasonable abstractions such as:

- A delicate type system featuring first-class types, [parameter annotations](docs/lynx-overview.md#parameter-annotations), [contextual](docs/lynx-overview.md#contextual-parameters) & [implicit parameters](docs/lynx-overview.md#implicit-parameters)...
- Lambda expressions with multi-branch pattern matching.
- Customizable infix operators and metaprogramming capability.

It encourges a functional style, and yet emphasizes freedom of expression over an enforced paradigm.

## Documentation

Here is a [language overview](docs/lynx-overview.md).

For a glimpse at Lynx code, please refer to the [examples](examples) folder.

Note that the current syntax is not yet complete,
and significant modifications are expected in the future.
