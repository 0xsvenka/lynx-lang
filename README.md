# The Lynx programming language

Note: Lynx is still in the early stage of development. Stay tuned :)

## Design philosophy

_Simplicity, consistency, flexibility — and being intuitive._

Lynx grows out of my exploration in [operator](docs/lynx-overview.md#operator)-based syntax, [type system](docs/lynx-overview.md#type-system), and [metaprogramming](docs/lynx-overview.md#macros).

## Documentation

Here is a [language overview](docs/lynx-overview.md).

For a glimpse at Lynx code, please refer to the [examples](examples/) folder.

Note that the current syntax is not yet complete, with significant modifications expected in the future.
